Hello World!

Leah Suzette Noumoff here, artist, designer, writer, and lover of creating! This is pretty much the beginning of my journey learning to code, and learning to utilize the platform known as GitHub. Here we go!

I'm creating this repository today, to give you a little background... an "About Me", if you will.

I don't really believe in job titles, but ultimately, I am an <em>artist</em> and I do a lot of different work from that place of being. You could call me <em>a digital designer, a visual storyteller, a marketing and branding specialist, a budding web developer, the Hostess with the Mostess, a writer, an organization fiend, a Feminist, a volunteer, a hippie, a self-proclaimed grill master</em>... but here, you can just call me Leah.

Nice to meet you!

If you're looking for someone to help you with your creative projects and ideas, you've come to the right place. I specialize in creative direction, idea generation, content creation and aesthetic experiences. I believe that great design speaks for itself, and that sharing your unique story with the world is what truly drives business. My focus as a creative professional is to design content that tells a story. But not just any story - <strong>your story.</strong> In sharing your story, no matter who you are, connections are found. Creating a connection to you and your brand doesn't just generate buyers - it builds loyal customers and followers.

In addition, it is my truth that there is a creative spirit in each and every one of use souls, here, having this shared human experience on our Mother Earth, and it is my personal mission to provide people with the tools and resources to tap into that light. To that end, please also visit my online portfolio and blog @ <a href="www.leahsuzette.wordpress.com">Leah Suzette dot Wordpress dot COM.</a>, for all things art & design, branding, dev and life!

w Love
Leah Suzette Noumoff
